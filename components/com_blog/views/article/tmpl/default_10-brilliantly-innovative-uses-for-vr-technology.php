              <p>Virtual reality is the new exciting frontier when it comes to digital media.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The industries that commonly spring to mind when talking about VR are computer gaming, entertainment and real estate.</p>
              <p>However the possibilities of VR technology go much further than simply enhancing what we already do. Read below for ten exciting uses that demonstrate virtual reality’s tremendous capacity and versatility for change.</p>

            <h3>Virtual Sports</h3>
            <p>In 2015 we saw the beginning of the emergence of live 3D virtual reality sports.</p>
            <p>Partnering with NextVR, the Golden State Warriors provided a immersive live VR experience, transporting the user courtside for a full NBA game. While the experience was a bit choppy, it showed a glimpse of how VR could revolutionise the spectating experience for sports fans.</p>
            <p>The NBA has committed to broadcasting at least one VR game in the 2016/2017 season in 360 degree video. On top of that we are seeing other sports jump on board, with boxing taking you ringside and UFC also considering the technology.</p>
            <p>With some of the world’s biggest sports brands behind it, it's hard to imagine VR in sports won’t be making huge strides in the near future.</p>
            <h3 class="mt+b">Military Training</h3>
            <p>One of the clearest benefits that VR holds is that it can fully transport a person into any environment without any of the dangers and pitfalls.</p>
            <p>This is very attractive to all arms of the military, for obvious reasons. The army, navy and air force all use virtual reality technology predominantly for training purposes. The preparation that non-commercial games that military organisations have been able to develop give them the ability to familiarise their troops with specific scenarios to a degree that was previously only possible in an actual combat situation.</p>
            <p>Virtual reality can also be beneficial to military personnel dealing with PTSD. The idea here being that the immersive technology can expose sufferers to their triggers and help them gradually adjust. </p>
            <h3 class="mt+b">Healthcare</h3> 
            <p>The healthcare industry have been among the earliest adopters and innovators within the field of VR.</p>
            <p>One of the most significant benefits VR offers in this field is the modelling it can produce of patient’s internal issues. Specialist software companies Surgical Theater and Conquer Mobile, take information from CAT scans or ultrasounds to create 3D diagnostic models. This allows for more accurate diagnosis, giving the medical professionals a more accurate view of what they are dealing with.</p>
            <p>The second huge advantage is the scope for advanced training. VR is the most accurate way to produce a realistic environment to so a medical professional can practice the most difficult procedures without the need for a human body.</p>
            <h3 class="mt+b">Virtual Reality in Business</h3>
            <p>Like with all new developments, savvy business people are leveraging VR technology to get an edge in their industry.</p>
            <p>This edge can take shape in many forms; a wedding reception business could set up a virtual tour of their space to better serve time-poor couples. Companies can better train employees through VR training modules, and online stores can provide a 360 degree view of their product to give customers the full experience before buying.</p>
            <p>Overall, when it comes to looking impressive, VR can always deliver. The Golden State Warriors leveraged their innovative position as leaders when it comes to sports VR as part of their <a href="http://www.si.com/tech-media/2016/12/09/golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-virtual-reality" target="_blank">pitch to signing Kevin Durant</a>, a major recruiting coup.</p>
            <p>Businesses all around the world are starting to use virtual reality to achieve a significant point of difference.</p>
            <h3 class="mt+b">Space Exploration</h3>
            <p>Scientists are using VR technology to accelerate their capacity to explore the final frontier.</p>
            <p>Being able to produce fully immersive environments has exciting implications for a field that operates at the most remote regions of the human experience.  NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has already begun experimenting with the integration of the Oculus Rift in conjunction with their robotics technology to create a mechanical arm that is operated via gestures through motion sensing equipment. The hope is that this technology could one day be used to control exploration rovers millions of miles from the source - leading to more precise and productive expeditions.</p>
            <p>The other side of VR and space exploration is that it can enhance the way space travel is communicated with the wider public. At the 2016 Consumer Electronic Show NASA used VR technology to directly share the on-board experience of various spacecraft’s. As VR technology is advanced and refined, the potential of bringing the interstellar experience to the home will only grow more spectacular.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mt+b">Museums and other tours</h3>
            <p>One of the most exciting features of virtual reality is that it allows someone to consume the same experience simultaneously with millions of people, but allows the user to retain their autonomy as if they were really there.</p>
            <p>This makes it the perfect medium for anything like an exhibition or a tour. </p>
            <p>Museums around the world have begun developing their capacity to deliver VR experiences of their exhibitions. In 2015 the British Museum in London had their first ever virtual reality weekend and the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has made sections of its exhibition available as a VR walkthrough permanently in partnership with Google cardboard.</p>
            <p>As this technology develops it could expand even further to things like city walking tours or even tours of natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef or Mount Everest. While traditionalists and luddites might sniff at this idea, it offers a way of seeing the world while leaving a lighter footprint and preserves the experience for future generations that otherwise might not be so lucky.</p>
            <h3 class="mt+">Courtrooms</h3>
            <p>VR is not present in courtrooms today but there are early signs it could become an integral part of the process in the future.</p>
            <p>Researchers at the University of Zurich posted a paper in 2014 that examined the effect on jury members when a crime scene was recreated for them using virtual reality. The study concluded that the use of the technology helped the jurors better understand the details of a case and gave them a better platform to make an informed decision.</p>
            <h3 class="mt+">Mental Health</h3>
            <p>As already touched on in the ‘Military’ section, researchers are finding that VR can be extremely productive when it comes to treating conditions that involve debilitating stress such as PTSD, panic disorders and phobias. The virtual reality technology acts as a safe and controlled environment in which patients can confront the things that trigger their stress and learn to control their response.</p>
            <p>This idea is backed up by a study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 2014 which found that VR exposure therapy was as effective when treating war veterans with PTSD as a combination of therapy and medication.</p>
            <h3 class="mt+">Driver Education</h3>
            <p>As part of their TeenDrive365 campaign, Toyota have been using VR to teach about the consequences of distracted driving. A virtual reality application recreated a driving experience to show the effect that distractions had on a person’s ability to operate a vehicle. <a href="http://www.brightlineinteractive.com/project/toyota-teen-drive-365/" target="_blank">Check out the video here.</a></p>
            <p>The simulation of complicated concepts has been shown to make cognitive learning more efficient. The scope for education through VR devices is enormous, not just for young people, but in all areas of life.</p>
            <h3 class="mt+">Construction</h3>
            <p>Virtual reality in the world of construction is the next logical step up from small scale models and CGI concept images.</p>
            <p>3D rendering of any proposed structures can allow for better access architectural designs and help to comprehensively identify issues before they are in place and will cost significant amounts of money to rectify.</p>
            <p>In a line of work where inefficiency has such a major impact on profit, VR shapes up as an incredibly powerful tool.</p>
